# MeteorSquad

This is the installer of my Master's Degree in Game Programming & Development project. Meteor Squad is a FPS multiplayer game developed with Unreal Engine 4 by a team comprised of students of four different courses (Game Design, Game Programming, Game Concept Art and Game Marketing and Production).

Please contact me at jlpascualmora@gmail.com if you have any questions or any trouble installing the game.
